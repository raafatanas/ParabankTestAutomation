## 📥 Installation
### Cloning the Repository
Clone the repository to your local machine:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/raafatanas/ParabankTestAutomation.git
```

### Importing into IntelliJ IDEA from VCS
1. Open IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Go to `File > New > Project from Version Control`.
3. Select `Git` and enter the repository URL: `https://github.com/raafatanas/ParabankTestAutomation.git`.
4. Click `Clone`.

### Dependencies
The project dependencies are managed through Maven, which automatically handles downloading and configuration. Key dependencies include:
- **Selenium WebDriver** for browser automation.
- **TestNG** and **JUnit** for testing framework support.
- **Allure TestNG** for reporting.
- **AspectJ Weaver** for AOP (Aspect-Oriented Programming) support.

For the complete list of dependencies, please refer to the [`pom.xml`](https://github.com/ChatGTHB/ParabankTestAutomation/blob/main/pom.xml) file.

## ⚙️ Usage
### Running Tests
You can run the tests either from the terminal or directly in IntelliJ IDEA.

#### Terminal
To run all test classes with Maven, use:
```bash
mvn test
```

#### IntelliJ IDEA
1. Open the project in IntelliJ IDEA.
2. Navigate to the test class you want to run.
3. Right-click on the test class or method and select **Run**.

## ✨ Features
- **Page Object Model (POM)**: Clean and maintainable code structure.
- **TestNG & JUnit Integration**: Comprehensive test coverage using TestNG and JUnit.
- **Allure Reporting**: Generate in-depth and user-friendly test reports.
- **AspectJ for AOP**: Support for cross-cutting concerns such as logging.

For additional details on each feature and to explore the code, please refer to the relevant sections in the project.

## 📊 Allure Reports and Jenkins Integration
This project utilizes **Allure** for creating detailed test execution reports. Allure reports provide insights into test results, including passed, failed, and skipped test cases. Reports can be generated and viewed locally using:

```bash
# Generate Allure report
allure serve
```

For CI/CD, the project is compatible with **Jenkins**. Jenkins can automate test runs, generate Allure reports after each build, and provide a historical view of test stability, which is essential for maintaining high software quality standards.

## 🔧 Configuration
- **pom.xml**: Manage dependencies and plugins.

## 📚 Documentation
Detailed documentation is available in each class and method. Key documentation tools include:
- **JavaDocs** in code for inline documentation.
- **README.md** for setup and usage instructions.
- [**Selenium Documentation**](https://www.selenium.dev/documentation/)
- [**TestNG Documentation**](https://testng.org/doc/)
- [**Jenkins Documentation**](https://www.jenkins.io/doc/)
- [**Allure Documentation**](https://docs.qameta.io/allure/)

## 🛠️ Troubleshooting
If you encounter issues:
1. Verify Maven dependencies are correctly configured.
2. Check configurations in `pom.xml`.
3. For CI/CD issues, verify Jenkins configurations and Allure plugins.
